# 🎨 Vision-Project [AIR CANVAS]

**Vision-Project-AIR-CANVAS-** is a real-time computer vision application that lets users draw in the air using only their index finger and a webcam. Built by [Jitendra0730](https://github.com/Jitendra0730), this project uses **MediaPipe** for hand tracking and **OpenCV** to visualize strokes on a virtual canvas — no stylus or touchscreen required. Just gestures and creativity!
