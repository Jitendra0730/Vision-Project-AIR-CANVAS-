# 🎨 Vision Air Canvas
Vision Air Canvas is an innovative real-time computer vision application that lets users draw in mid-air using only their index finger and a webcam. It leverages **MediaPipe** for precise hand tracking and **OpenCV** to render strokes onto a virtual canvas — no stylus or touchscreen needed, just gestures and imagination!

## 📌 Key Features
  - 🖐 Hand gesture recognition via MediaPipe

  - 🎨 Real-time air drawing using finger motion

  - 🖌 Color selection options (Blue, Green, Red, Yellow)

  - 🧼 Gesture-based canvas clearing

  - 🖥 Tkinter-based GUI for Start/Stop controls

  - 💡 On-screen interactive buttons overlaid on video feed

## 🛠 Technology Stack
  - **Python 3**

  - **OpenCV**

  - **MediaPipe**

  - **NumPy**
 
  - **Tkinter**

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Hand Detection**: MediaPipe identifies and tracks hand landmarks, focusing on the index and thumb.

2. **Drawing Mechanism**:

  - Move the index finger to draw on the screen.

  - Bring the thumb and index finger together to pause drawing.

3. **On-Screen Controls**:

  - Tap virtual buttons to change drawing colors.

  - Clear the canvas with a gesture.

4. **GUI Control Panel**: A Tkinter window lets you start or stop the application easily.
